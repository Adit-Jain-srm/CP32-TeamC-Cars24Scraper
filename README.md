# CP32 — Team C — Cars24 Web Scraping Mini Project

A concise, professional documentation hub for Team C's internship mini project on web scraping car listings from Cars24.

### Project Objective
Develop hands-on skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and structured data presentation by extracting car details from Cars24. The focus is on listings in India, with location handling as specified below.

### Scope and Assignment
- **Team**: Team C (CP32)
- **Assigned Brand**: Hyundai
- **Scraping Target**: Cars listed on Cars24 from **three locations**
- **Primary Location Focus**: Mumbai (change location if Hyundai listings are unavailable and document the change)

### Data Fields to Collect
- **Kilometers Driven**
- **Year of Manufacture**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Price**

### Workflow (Steps to Follow)
1) **Research and Planning**
   - Understand page structure and identify HTML elements/selectors that contain the required fields.
2) **Data Extraction**
   - Write a script to scrape the five required fields for Hyundai across three locations (adjusting location if needed for the brand-only case).
3) **Data Cleaning**
   - Normalize, validate, and structure the data for analysis.
4) **Data Presentation**
   - Export the cleaned dataset to a well-structured CSV.

### Special Instructions
- If Hyundai cars are not available in the Mumbai location, change the location to scrape data for Hyundai only.
- Clearly **document any location changes** and the **reason** for each change.
- Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and the website’s terms of service while scraping.

### Deliverables
1) **Python Notebook (.ipynb)**: Well-documented notebook used for scraping and cleaning.
2) **Presentation (PDF)**: Summarizes the approach, key steps, and outputs.
3) **Brief Report**: Outlines the process, challenges, solutions, and insights from the data.

### Team C
